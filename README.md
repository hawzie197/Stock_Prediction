# Stock_Prediction

This algorithmn uses linear regression to learn from previous stock trends in order to predict the future stock values. 

If you do not know what linear regression is, here is a short definition and chart example:


Google states that "In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable (independent variable) is called simple linear regression (Google)."

So basically in our case, we are creating a linear pattern of all previous stock values.
